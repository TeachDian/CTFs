**Description**

What was I last working on? I remember writing a note to help me remember...\
You can download the challenge files here:\
challenge.zip

**Hints**
1. The cat command will let you read a file, but that won't help you here
1. Read the chapter on Git from the picoPrimer here<https://primer.picoctf.org/#_git_version_control>.
1. When committing a file with git, a message can (and should) be included.
