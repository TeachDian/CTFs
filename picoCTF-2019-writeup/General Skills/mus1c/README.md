## Problem Statement
> I wrote you a [song](lyrics.txt). Put it in the picoCTF{} flag format
## Hints
> Do you think you can master rockstar?
## Solution
As the hint suggests, we are looking at the esoteric language of Rockstar. Simply compile it on their [online compiler](https://codewithrockstar.com/online) and convert the output to ASCII to get the flag.
## Flag
`picoCTF{rrrocknrn0113r}`
