## Problem Statement
> If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?
## Hints
> Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.
## Solution
We are given a hexadecimal value and asked the convert it to ASCII. The easiest way to go around this is to just put it through a hex-to-ascii conversion online site such as [RapidTables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-hex-bin-dec-converter.html).
## Flag
`picoCTF{p}`
