## Solution
This problem is a simple base conversion problem, pretty much the same idea as 2Warm, converting a hexadecimal (base 16) number to a decimal (base 10) number. The easiest way to tackle it is to just put it through a base conversion online site such as [RapidTables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html).
