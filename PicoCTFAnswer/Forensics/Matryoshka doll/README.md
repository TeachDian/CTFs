# What I Did

When i put the image in exiftool i see that this file might can be extracted.
<img src="Pic_1.JPG">

So i try to change it to zip and extract it, it gives me another file that can be extracted
so i keep repeating the step until i get the flag
and the flag is

``` 

picoCTF{4f11048e83ffc7d342a15bd2309b47de} 

```
