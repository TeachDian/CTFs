# What I Did
I received a link, and when I curled it, I got an encrypted flag: "picoCTF{gvswwmrkxlivyfmgsrhnrisegl}." Since it seemed like a Caesar cipher, I ran a Python script to try every possible combination. Among the results, one stood out: "crossingtherubicondjneoach." The presence of "crossingtherubicon" made it seem like a potential flag to me.
So i tried the flag and the flag get accepted.


``` picoCTF{crossingtherubicondjneoach} ```
