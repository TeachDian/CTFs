# Hints
1. any redirections?

# What I Did

I tried everything on this website checking all sources that available
Then i tried to input the given username and password. Then i get in to
"search for flags" page, this CTF case is really confusing since there are
a lot of things here and everything is related to the hints (redirection).

and then I use burpsuite to see each of the redirection. Then i found something
that looks like base64(Pic_4) its
``` bF90aGVfd2F5X2JlNzE2ZDhlfQ== ```

and the decoded version is 
``` l_the_way_be716d8e} ```

then i realise its actually the back part of the flag,
so i look again each of the redirection in burpsuite
hoping i found the other part of the flag in base64.

then i see this (Pic_6) and I try to decode it using
base64 and i get the first part of the flag
``` cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs ```

and the decoded version is
``` picoCTF{proxies_al ``` 

and the flag is 

```picoCTF{proxies_all_the_way_be716d8e}```
