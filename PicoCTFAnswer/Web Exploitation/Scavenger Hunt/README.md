# Scavenger Hunt

There is some interesting information hidden around this site (link). Can you find it?


# Hints
1. You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

# What I Did

I checked all the button in the website. Since i don't see any request to other link, i inspect the source of the page
then i found the first part of the flag in the HTML file

```picoCTF{t```

the second part of the flag is in the CSS file

```h4ts_4_l0```

and then in the javascript file i found the clue for the
third part of the flag

```How can I keep Google from indexing my website? ```

then I search in google "google indexing website" and I found the 
documentation of how google indexing a website in this link

https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7645831?hl=en

then I tried to open the (link)/robots.txt, I found another clue
to the next part of the flag 
"I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?"
and found the 
third part of the flag which is

```t_0f_pl4c```

The fourth part of the flag is related to apache server
thing, so I look at apache documentation and one of the
section is explaining about directory things in apache
in this link
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/htaccess.html

then i tried to open the (link)/.access, I got the fifth part of
the flag clue which is 
"I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there."

and I got the
fourth part of the flag

```3s_2_lO0k```

for the fifth flag, I failed to find the documentation
of the mac os that explaining about website development
but I found it on the CTF write ups(https://ctftime.org/writeup/26981).
It tells me that i need to use (link)/.DS_Store
and I got the 
fifth part of the flag

```_fa04427c}```

and the flag is 

```picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_fa04427c}```
