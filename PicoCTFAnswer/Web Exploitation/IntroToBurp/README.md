# IntroToBurp
Try here to find the flag

# Hints
1. Try using burpsuite to intercept request to capture the flag.
2. Try mangling the request, maybe their server-side code doesn't handle malformed requests very well.

# What I Did
At first i search for any suspicious text that might be encrypted or encoded
flag in the burpsuite, but sadly there is nothing to do with the encrypted and decoded
text in the burpsuite.

I observed the whole activities and trying to understand how does the website works.
Until i figured out that might be i need to do something with the otp in http request
(Pic_4)

I tried to bruteforce it at first but it turns out i just need to delete the
otp request.
