# What I Did

I thought this is a sql injection but then i cant use
sql injection script, then i inspect the element of the website
, then i tried to login and inspect the element. In the js file i
found an username and its password it is 
admin:strongPassword098765. I use it to login.

and then the flag is 

``` picoCTF{j5_15_7r4n5p4r3n7_05df90c8} ```
