# GET aHEAD
Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of
this competition (link)

# Hints
1. Maybe you have more than 2 choices
2. Check out tools like Burpsuite to modify your
requests and look at the responses

# What I Did
From a glance, in the webpage i see that there are two buttons, that send
a form request, one button using get and the other using post method.

So from the first hint "maybe you have more than 2 choices" as i know that
the first choice is using get method and the second using post method, so
if the hint say that we might choose another choices than i assume that 
the another choices mean another HTTP Request Methods.

from the title we can see that it give us a clue that we need to GET a HEAD
which is refer to HEAD request method. So to get the flag we need to 
request for the website header using this command in terminal 

```bash
curl -I <link>
```
and the flag is 

```bash
picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_8f878508}
```
