# Hints
1. It ain't much, but it's an RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616

# What I Did
When i open the website i see that i need to edit the header
so i can set the user-agent to picobrowser, so i used Burpsuite
in this CTF question.

first i intercept and edit the header User-Agent
``` User-Agent: picobrowser ```

next the clue is "I don't trust users visiting from another site."
in the website that given by the hint (pic_3)
``` Referer: http://mercury.picoctf.net:46199/ ```

next clue is "Sorry, this site only worked in 2018."
so i need to change the date of my http request using Date (pic_5)
``` Date: Mon, 29 Oct 2018 19:43:31 GMT ```

next clue is "I don't trust users who can be tracked.".
I didn't manage to find any information from the hint document
So i asked chatgpt about it and it gives me some of request-header
and one that works for this question is DNT
``` DNT: 1 ```

next clue is "This website is only for people from Sweden."
I tried to change the location from the header but it does nothing
and chatgpt didn't give good answer so I read some ctf write ups
and we can use X-Forwarded-For:swedenip to change the location
``` X-Forwarded-For: 104.66.120.5 ```

next clue is "You're in Sweden but you don't speak Swedish?"
for this i need to change the accept-language to swedish
``` Accept-Language: sv;q=1, en-GB;q=0.9, en-US;q=0.8 ```

and then the flag is 

``` picoCTF{http_h34d3rs_v3ry_c0Ol_much_w0w_8d5d8d77} ```
