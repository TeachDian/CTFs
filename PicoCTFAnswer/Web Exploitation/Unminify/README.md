# Unminify
I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!
Browse here, and find the flag!

# Hints
1. Try CTRL+U / âŒ˜+U in your browser to view the page source. You can also add 'view-source:' before the URL, or try curl <URL> in your shell.
2. Minification reduces the size of code, but does not change its functionality.
3. What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting.

# What I Did

I open the page source, and then use this html beautifier
https://codebeautify.org/htmlviewer

then i see the flag inside the html code
