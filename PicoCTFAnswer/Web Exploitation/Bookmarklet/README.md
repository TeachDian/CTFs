# Bookmarklet
Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?
Browse here, and find the flag!

# Hints
1. A bookmarklet is a bookmark that runs JavaScript instead of loading a webpage.
2. What happens when you click a bookmarklet?
3. Web browsers have other ways to run JavaScript too.

# What I Did

In the webpage it showed me a javascript code that contain the encrypted flag.
After analyzing the code, i need to run the javascript code to decrypt the flag,
i just copy and paste the javascript code to the console and it shows me the flag
