# What I Did
1. First thing first I input "Snickerdoodle" in the input bar first because 
the placeholder is saying that word (look pic_1).
2. It returns me something but not flag. (look pic_2).
3. From the title of this question (cookies) i think there might
be something related to cookies in the website. So i open 
inspect and go to application part then find where the cookies are stored (look pic_3).
4. I tried to press the "home" button and keep looking on the cookies, and i found that the
cookies with the name "name" get the value changed to -1 (look pic_4).
5. And then I tried to edit the cookies and changed it values to 1 2 3 and so on until i 
found the flag at values ```18``` (look pic_5,6,7)

and the flag is 

```bash
picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_a1f5bdb7}
```
