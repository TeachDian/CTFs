# Hints
1. XML external entity Injection

# What I Did

From the hints it told us that this is
a XXE injection, so I use burpsuite to
see any data request.

Then I see the xml in the http request (Pic_3)
so I open https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing
and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjm6VHZa_8s
to see how xml and xxe work
and I get this result that I can use

```bash
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE ID [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<data><ID>&xxe;</ID></data>
```

so the website is basically works by printing
anything inside the <ID></ID> even
if the value is not valid it prints the value (Pic_4 & Pic_5).
So what I need to do is just change the xml
with our xml and I get the flag

the flag is 

``` picoCTF{XML_3xtern@l_3nt1t1ty_540f4f1e} ```
