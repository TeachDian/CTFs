# logon
The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at?  (link)

# Hints
1. Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?

# What I Did

I tried to login as other than Joe then i look the cookies
that stored in the memory. I saw that there is a cookie with 
the name admin and the value is False so i set it to True
and then after i refresh the page i get the flag.

The flag is 

``` picoCTF{th3_c0nsp1r4cy_l1v3s_0c98aacc} ```
