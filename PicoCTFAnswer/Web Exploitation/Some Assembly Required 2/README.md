# What I Did
I open the script file that used in the website
and deobfuscate it using this
https://obf-io.deobfuscate.io/

and i ask chatgpt to change the variable name so i can analyze
the code easier (I put the code in the script.js). Based on the code,
I can see that the website is fetching something from another
file. So i open the network record in the web (Pic_5) and try to curl it.
The result of the curl looks like a gibberish, but on the bottom part
there is a line of string that looks suspicious, so i try to put it in
cyberchef and luckily it gives me the flag
