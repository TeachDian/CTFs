# where are the robots
Can you find the robots? (link)

# Hints
1. What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

# What I Did

Seeing the title and description I knew that it has to
be something about robots.txt since the hints also tell us
about part of the website that tell where the creator 
doesn't want you to look.
So I put in the url (link)/robots.txt
and then I find another file url to input in the url field
It is 
/1bb4c.html

and then the flag is 

``` picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_1bb4c} ```
