## Writeup for yarn

Question

    I was told to use the linux strings command on yarn, but it doesn't work. Can you help? I lost the flag in the binary somewhere, and would like it back
    HINTS
    What does the strings command use to determine if something is a string?
    Is there an option to change the length of what strings considers as valid?

Cool! Let's download the file and open it up in a text editor.

Oh, what's this? It says right there "Submit_me_for_I_am_the_flag". Oh okay... well, let's submit that.

    Correct!
    
Oh. Okay. We're done I guess.
