# Bash Loop

```
We found a program that is hiding a flag but requires you to guess the number it is thinking of. Chances are Linux has an easy way to try all the numbers... Go to /problems/884bb3c8fc9e0dbccc09787c1b016cd4 and try it out!
HINTS
Either use SSH or use the Web Shell to get onto the shell server and navigate to the correct directory. Then do a quick Google search on 'bash loops'. You may need to use grep to filter out the responses as well!
```

To solve this one we have to guess correctly a number between 0 and 4096. To do this we will use an inline bash loop and then we will grep the output for the flag, since we would otherwise have to manually sort through 4097 lines of text. This must be done on shell2017.picoctf.com. We recommend connecting over ssh and not useing the web shell, which is kind of a buggy interface.

```
$ cd /problems/884bb3c8fc9e0dbccc09787c1b016cd4
$ for i in {0..4096}; do ./bashloop "$i"; done | grep flag
Yay! That's the number! Here be the flag: bcf9ac72d8721c303ae95239c2deacb3
$ 
```
