# ECC2

For this problem, we used the [Pohlig-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pohlig%E2%80%93Hellman_algorithm) algorithm, keeping in mind that every small increase in the scalar of a subgroup results in a large change to the final scalar and the overall bound, we better computer the bounds for each Baby Step-Giant Step search on the subgroups.
