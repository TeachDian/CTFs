### Description: 
We found this file. Recover the flag.

### Solution:
Seeing as the downloadable file named "tunn3lv1s1on" is of an unknown file type we run exiftool on it to determine that it is a bitmap image (bmp). The image does not display properly when we open it so we can figure it must be corrupted somehow:

```

Finding this wikipedia article about the BMP file format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format) we step through the hex bytes of the image and modify them in an attempt to un-corrupt the image. To do this I would reccomend using a hex editor. Personally I use HexEditor Neo because it is free and I am familiar with it but any should work just fine.
![Original Header Bytes](https://github.com/ZeroDayTea/PicoCTF-2021-Killer-Queen-Writeups/blob/main/Forensics/snip1.PNG)

As seen in the screenshot the first few bytes of the header to the bitmap image are:
```
42 4d 8e 26 2c 00 00 00 00 00 ba d0 00 00 ba d0
00 00 6e 04 00 00 32 01
```
Seeing as the number of bytes in the DIB header are wrong and the number of bits per pixel are also wrong we realize we need to edit the bytes at offset 0x0e and 0x1c. The
correct bytes are as follows:
```
42 4d 8e 26 2c 00 00 00 00 00 ba d0 00 00 28 00
00 00 6e 04 00 00 40 03
```
Changing the "ba d0" of the DIB header num-bytes to "28 00" and changing the "32 01" of the number of bits per pixel to "40 03" does the trick and we get the proper image.
Renaming the "tunn3lv1s10n" file to "tunn3lv1s10n.bmp" we are able to open it and get the flag.
