## Description
Can you get the flag? Go to this website and see what you can discover.
### Hint
- Is there more code than what the inspector initially shows?
## Solution
On the website, it explains about the header files which we include in our file to extend its capabilities. Upon clicking "Say hello" button, a message pops up saying "This code is in a separate file!". Checking the source code gives us two files: `style.css` and `script.js`. Visiting both files gives us a part of our flag. The first half is in the `style.css` and the second is in `script.js`.
