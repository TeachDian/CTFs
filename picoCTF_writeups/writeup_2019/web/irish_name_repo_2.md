## Description
There is a website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/64649/ (link). Someone has bypassed the login before, and now it's being strengthened. Try to see if you can still login! or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:64649
### Hint
- The password is being filtered.
## Solution
This challenge is similar to the 'Irish-Name-Repo 1' challenge where we need to exploit a SQL vulnerability in the authentication process. We can use the same payload to exploit this challenge as well. Therefore, we can similarly approach this challenge as we did with the previous one.
